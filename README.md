The folder structure:
amazon_india_project/
│── data/                # Raw and cleaned datasets
│── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for cleaning & EDA
│── scripts/             # Python scripts for automation
│── sql/                 # SQL schema & queries
│── dashboard/           # Power BI or Streamlit files
│── reports/             # PDF/Word reports
│── README.md            # Project documentation

Let me explain the best approach for this Amazon India project step-by-step.

📍 Recommended Workflow
1️⃣ Start Locally, Then Push to GitHub
Why?
You’ll be working with large datasets (~1M rows) — much easier to process locally.
You can test scripts, run heavy EDA, and build dashboards without worrying about internet/Git sync issues.
Once your code is stable, you push it to GitHub for backup, version control, and sharing.
📍 Step-by-Step Setup
Step 1: Create the Project Locally
On your computer:

Choose a location (e.g., Documents/Projects/ or D:/DataScienceProjects/).
Create the folder:
mkdir amazon_india_project
cd amazon_india_project
Inside, create the folder structure:
amazon_india_project/
│── data/                # Raw and cleaned datasets
│── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for cleaning & EDA
│── scripts/             # Python scripts for automation
│── sql/                 # SQL schema & queries
│── dashboard/           # Power BI or Streamlit files
│── reports/             # PDF/Word reports
│── README.md            # Project documentation
Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Folder
If you want version control from the start:

git init
Step 3: Create a GitHub Repository
Go to
GitHub
. 2. Click New Repository → Name it amazon-india-sales-analytics. 3. Do not initialize with README (you already have one locally). 4. Copy the repo URL (HTTPS or SSH).

Step 4: Link Local Project to GitHub
In your terminal:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-india-sales-analytics.git
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
git push -u origin main
Step 5: Work Locally, Commit Often
Daily workflow:
Work in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
Save changes.
Commit:
git add .
git commit -m "Completed data cleaning step 1-3"
git push
This way, GitHub always has your latest progress.
Step 6: When to Push to GitHub
Push after each major step:
Data cleaning completed.
EDA completed.
SQL integration done.
Dashboard ready.
This creates checkpoints in case you need to roll back.
📌 Summary
Do heavy work locally (because of big dataset & processing speed).
Use GitHub for version control and to share the final project.
Push after each milestone so you have backups.
💡 Pro Tip:
If you want to collaborate or work from multiple devices, you can clone the GitHub repo on each device and pull changes before working.
