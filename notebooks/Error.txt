Thanks for sharing the full output ‚Äî you're very close, but here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:

‚ùå What Went Wrong

You successfully installed Git LFS ‚úÖ

You added *.csv to be tracked with LFS ‚úÖ

But this line failed:

fatal: pathspec 'your_large_file.csv' did not match any files


That's because "your_large_file.csv" was just a placeholder ‚Äî you didn‚Äôt replace it with the actual filename.

Then you pushed again ‚Äî but Git is still trying to upload the entire 375MB commit, and failing with:

error: RPC failed; curl 55 Send failure: Connection was aborted


This confirms:

The large file is still in Git history, even if it's deleted now.

You‚Äôre still trying to push that giant pack, even though LFS is initialized.

‚úÖ How to Fix It (Step-by-Step)

We now need to:

‚û§ Remove the large file from Git history
‚û§ Re-add it using Git LFS
‚û§ Force-push the cleaned repo
üßπ Step 1: Remove the Large File from History Using BFG
üî∏ First, download the BFG Repo Cleaner

Then, from your terminal in the repo root:

Backup your repo (optional but smart):

git clone --mirror . ../amazon-india-project-backup.git


Run BFG to remove files over 100MB:

java -jar path\to\bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M


Clean up old references:

git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

üì¶ Step 2: Re-add the Large CSV File via Git LFS

Now that it's removed from history:

Make sure the CSV is back in the working directory:
Place amazon_india_complete_2015_2025.csv back into data/ if it's not already there.

Track .csv via Git LFS (already done):
Confirm .gitattributes has this line:

*.csv filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text


Add the file and commit:

git add data/amazon_india_complete_2015_2025.csv
git commit -m "Re-add large CSV file via Git LFS"

üöÄ Step 3: Push Everything

Push with force (required because history changed):

git push origin main --force

üß† Why This Works

Git LFS stores large files outside of Git's internal object storage, so it avoids:

RPC timeouts

File size limits

Bloated repo size

‚úÖ After This, You Should See:

A successful push

Your CSV file in GitHub (represented by a pointer file)

No GitHub error about file size

Would you like me to walk you through using BFG or help verify the CSV is still in history?
